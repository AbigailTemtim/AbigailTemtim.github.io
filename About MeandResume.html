                <li>Some accomplishments mentioned on my resume:</li> 
                    <li>INFO research 2| Quantitative Reasoning | Jan – May 2019</li> 
                        <li>Developed knowledge in computer programming with an algebraic application to interpret real life situations and different data types within python. Assignments for this class required students to cover combinatorics, set theory, and probability which has allowed me to better code and analyze data.</li>
                    <li>INFO research 2| Computational Reasoning | Aug – Dec 2019</li>
                        <li>This project was focused on crime database only. I Investigated FBI’s API to find the most and least dangerous cities in the US in regard to crime. I was able to find the many other factors that play a role into what makes the city dangerous. While I learned to compare offender and victim data from the most and least dangerous cities, I developed skills in navigating API, XML, and HTML.</li>
                    <li>Volunteer Leadership</li>
                         <li>Global Seminar in the Dominican Republic allowed me to further my knowledge on the effect of the government in the poorest parts (bateyes) in Santo Domingo. In addition, my peers and I helped rebuild homes for those who have been stripped of their citizenship. Submerging myself in a different culture allowed me to develop adaptation skills and further improve my communication skills.</li>
        </ul>
