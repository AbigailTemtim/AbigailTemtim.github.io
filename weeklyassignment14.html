<p> Jupyter notebook allows you to code or decode a variety of different sources. You can read files, use pandas, APIs, and all these to demonstrate how useful you can be to a company. It is a source that can easily be understood and teaches you where your errors are coming from. I learned a lot from the mistakes I was making. I learned from my mistakes. Employers can quickly see how you can integrate tools you have learned about. You can easily showcase your work and see the codes and the results. It is easy to track your progress on the documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. I have delved into interest. I have used python for class projects, and I just find it dope, and I am sure it is something employers look for.</p>
<p>RevealJS can be a useful tool for HTML presentation framework. All the tools allow people to create spectacular presentations for free. It can definitely be used for any kind of pitch night. I recently had the opportunity to work on a business plan for my business minor and it's a tool I would have wanted to implement for pitch night. It could make a considerable impression on judges if we used a tool as such. It can easily sway their thought processes if put together without a business plan using the skills we learned from this study area. It is easy to understand and use because the website for RevealJS stuff has a tutorial and example code to start with.</p>
<p>APIs can make it easy to access and manipulate data as long as the API provider makes it accessible for you. I loved using APIs for class projects. Students could have the most significant advantage for this use, in my opinion. It makes relevant data available for you so quickly. It allows interaction with external software components, operating systems, or microservices.</p>
