        <h1> Weekly assignment #4</h1> 
        <h2> TV show of my choosing: The Bachelor</h2>
        
        <h3> Intro:</h3>
        
        <p> For weekly assignment 4, I decided to look into The Bachelor because I am a fan of the show. I grabbed a dataset from Github regarding the contestants on the show throughout its 21 seasons. Specifically, I wanted to look into the patterns of choices of the bachelor throughout all the seasons. I wanted to investigate the types of people who stay longer on the show and why that might be. I believe that connection plays a huge role in who stays longer on the show. But, there are plenty of other external factors the bachelor needs to consider to see if it's a match that would work in the long run. I focused on the characteristics the women who made it further down in the elimination process share. The bachelor has to take into account the other external factors that make people more available to him because he is seeking a marriage partner. 
        </p>
        
        <h3> Paragraph 1:</h3>
        <p> I scrubbed the data and focused my research to revolve around the hometowns of the contestants who remain after week seven in all of the seasons of The Bachelor.  I chose to look at data after week seven because feelings are more serious. The bachelor can give more one-on-one attention and time instead of multiple girls fighting for it.  Feelings start to get reciprocated by the bachelor because he learns more about the girls; connections are more developed and genuine. By week seven, the bachelor is more serious about the people he sees, especially because hometowns are coming up. Hometowns are when the bachelor meets the contestant's family, and that's something serious for both parties. This approach of categorization gives insight into the patterns of the show throughout different seasons. It helps to gain more of an understanding of the winners and possible qualities they share. I looked at this website to give me more information for my categorization process for my scrubbed data on excel. I looked at this <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/former-bachelor-and-bachelorette-winners-where-are-they-now/helene-eksterowicz/"> webpage </a> to give me more information for my categorization process for my sccrubbed data on excel 
        </p>
        
        <h3> Paragraph 2:</h3>
        <p> I did split up my research into two, one that applies for girls who got eliminated from the show after week seven and for all girls who were winners of the show. The dataset gives name, age, hometown, elimination week, and season the contestants were on. I wanted to look into their hometowns as an indicator of how successful the area they come from is and for the winners I wanted the occupations of the winners throughout different seasons of the show. I categorized by coding the region the girls are from in the US whether it is West, Mid-West, South, North-East, and Canada. </p>
        <p> I used this map from google I used as a reference for categorizing the region the girls come from:</p>

        <p> This is my original dataset that I downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bachelorette">
            GitHub:</a></p>

        <h3> Paragraph 3:</h3>
        <p> The winners and their occupations are an interest of mine too because throughout the season there have been moments where people have had interesting <a href="https://www.insider.com/bachelor-and-bachelorette-jobs-explained-2018-6"> job-titles </a>. I wanted to see if people have made into the contest with jobs as such. From my observation and graphs I have made on excel, I could see the types of jobs have changed throughout the years of airing the show. However, it hasnâ€™t changed drastically where the winners are not the type of usual winners that have been displayed in the past. It makes me wonder if there is an actual consideration the bachelors make because all of the contestants who have won so far have been professionals in their field of work. </p>

        <h3> Conclusion:</h3>
       
        <p> One very noticeable thing I saw after reading this <a href="https://www.cabletv.com/blog/do-laurens-win-the-bachelor"> article </a> is that no women from different countries has made it past week or been a winner on the show. No one with weird job-titles has won before more of them tend to be professionals in their occupation. No unemployed contestant has won before. Most of the contestants who have made it past week seven come from the South. The number of people from the south that made it past week seven was 18 and the Min being 3, the contestants from Canada. The West and Midwest region had 11 contestants each and the North-East region had 5 that made it past seventh week.  I did the calculation using excel functions to tell me the Max and Min values.
