<h1 class="center-align">Weekly assignment #4</h1> 
<h2 class="center-align">TV show of my choosing: The Bachelor</h2>

<h3 class="right"> Intro:</h3>

<p> For weekly assignment 4, I decided to look into The Bachelor because I am a fan of the show. I grabbed a dataset from Github regarding the contestants on the show throughout its 21 seasons. Specifically, I wanted to look into the patterns of choices of the bachelor throughout all the seasons. I wanted to investigate the types of people who stay longer on the show and why that might be. I believe that connection plays a huge role in who stays longer on the show. But, there are plenty of other external factors the bachelor needs to consider to see if it's a match that would work in the long run. I focused on the characteristics the women who made it further down in the elimination process share. The bachelor has to take into account the other external factors that make people more available to him because he is seeking a marriage partner.

<h3 class="right"> Paragraph 1:</h3>

<p>I scrubbed the data and focused my research to revolve around the hometowns of the contestants who remain after week seven in all of the seasons of The Bachelor.  I chose to look at data after week seven because feelings are more serious. The bachelor can give more one-on-one attention and time instead of multiple girls fighting for it.  Feelings start to get reciprocated by the bachelor because he learns more about the girls; connections are more developed and genuine. By week seven, the bachelor is more serious about the people he sees, especially because hometowns are coming up. Hometowns are when the bachelor meets the contestant's family, and that's something serious for both parties. This approach of categorization gives insight into the patterns of the show throughout different seasons. It helps to gain more of an understanding of the winners and possible qualities they share. I looked at this website to give me more information for my categorization process for my scrubbed data on excel. I looked at this <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/former-bachelor-and-bachelorette-winners-where-are-they-now/helene-eksterowicz/"> webpage </a> to give me more information for my categorization process for my sccrubbed data on excel
