<p>I had heard a ton of stock talk the day this was going on, but I never really understood stocks. I was observing through the people I knew around me. I asked multiple people what was going on, and I got back confusing answers just because of my lack of knowledge on this topic. What I was able to grasp from all of this was the impact the collective made on GameStop stocks. I heard complaints from people about the app Robinhood because they were limiting and restricting people from buying stocks that were booming. For this assignment, however, I wanted to look at legitimate sites that spoke accurate facts about what happened, so I can make my interpretation, instead of what I heard from people partaking the day all this was happening. </p>
<p>If I were to explain from my research, I would start with Reddit. Reddit is a network of communities where people can join a community that sparks their interest. It is a platform where people join communities that talk about a variety of topics. There happened to be a community on Reddit called “Wall Street Bets”, where people created a plan to buy and hold GameStop stock. In this case, this allowed people from Reddit to go against well-funded wall street traders and caused friction between those people financially. GameStop was not a thriving business to have a surge increase in shareholders. GameStop is a company that's going out of business. There was nothing about the company that was causing all of this. People in the Reddit community plotted and wanted to go after wall street traders. The Atlantic even called it this as “a clever Reddit revenge plot, which targeted hedge funds, who made a reckless bet on a struggling retailer--and it's going to end with lots of people losing incredible amounts of money. (Thompson)”.
</p>
<p>The problem then moved to commission-free stock trading and investing app called Robinhood. The issue with that was once the company's stock moved from 40 to 400 in a couple of days, Robinhood platform had more than 50 % of their users holding shared in the company they started restricting trading for GameStop. Within an hour and twenty-five minutes, the stock went from $500 to $120, and it had upset plenty of people. Notable politicians were participating in the discussions about Robinhood's restrictions over Twitter, which caused more attention to the situation. Many were against the restriction Robinhood made for users, and the platform itself started getting a ton of complaints and horrible reviews and ratings.
</p>
<p>I’m not against using online platforms to engage in collective action unless it’s hurting our community as a whole. Although, in this case, I don't have personal experience or knowledge with stocks, so I wanted to make sure who would get hit and who would not before I could say it's a problem for the right community. Through my research, I also learned what short selling and short squeezes were. Short selling is a finance practice where investors borrow shares and sell them as soon as they can to later buy them back again. Short squeezing is an increase in stock price. 
</p>
<p>As an information science student, this was hard for me to grasp, however, I saw the community play and strategic aspect of it all. There were some dilemmas regarding the restriction of buyers from the platform Robinhood. Robinhood provides real-time last sale prices, so maybe data can be derived from that. I believe the responsibilities the users have when they join a platform are on them. A platform should not interfere with what people want to do, as long as they are not breaking any terms of services. </p>
